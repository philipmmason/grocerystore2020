                If you live in Florida then you are use to seeing Publix Super Markets as you drive through town but how much about your local 
                Publix Super Market do your know? Publix started provided good to its local community on September 6, 1930 in Winter Haven, Florida by George Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins store was successful enough to survive the Great Depression and 1935 he opened a second store. Over the years the company would continue to grow and by 1956 Publix made its first $1 million profit in a year. This was just the early success and development for Publix and would continue to grow in many ways.

                After 3 decades of success Publix began to expand through Florida to eventually become the prominent supermarket. This expansion began in 1959 and this would lead into other projects for Mr. Jenkins. The previous years the store expanded their inner store departments to provide full service to the customers. The stores had full-service bakery and floral departments. These full-service departments are what set Publix above the other grocery stores. In the years to follow Mr. Jenkins focused on the growth of the company and how to better serve his customers. Over the next 40-year Publix would expand through all of Florida as well as trying a few different types of store. One of these store designs was called Food World where the store was much larger and have a large deli where different type of food from all over the word would be offered. These large Food Worlds were not viable and ended up being converted to large Super Markets, but it was these innovative approaches that made Publix the premier Grocer in Florida.

                As an employee of Publix in my teenage years I remember that Publix had set a goal to open 1000 stores by year 2000. This goal was not met by the turn of the century but, the focus brought about by this goal help push Publix to cover the footprint that is currently has. It wasn't until 2009 before Publix opened it's 1000'th store and at this time was looking into expanding into other states. Now Publix is proudly servicing its high-quality goods and full-service departments in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.
